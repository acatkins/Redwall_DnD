# Redwall DnD

This work in progress should eventually be a complete framework for homebrew Redwall campaigns. The god of creation in this world, unknown to its denizens, is of course the author Brian Jacques.

There will be both contents in the repository for detailed information—such as spells, stats, and artifacts—and a wiki guiding anyone who wishes to use the material and providing the general world building theory.
